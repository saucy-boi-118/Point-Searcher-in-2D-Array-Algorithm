# Point-Searcher-in-2D-Array-Algorithm
An algorithm that finds a point from a 2d array

Written In C# with minimal help from Microsoft Copilot for debugging
Any help would be aprecciated
Experienced Developers please help

# How to run it
Download a C# extentsion in VS code or any IDE and open the terminal and run "dotnet run". This may vary from different devices and IDE's so you can always just plug it into an online C# compiler like Programix
# What it does
The algorithm essentially has a list of points in the form of a 2D array unsorted. It first sorts the points and uses a binary search to match it to the target.
# Why did I make it
I feel like it will be useful for future projects where you need to find a certain point like a special enemy out of many in a game so I made one.
# Extra Help Is Appreciated
Please if you have any ideas or optimization tricks for C# feel free to help
